# HR--Employee-Attrition-Analysis

 # Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze patterns and factors contributing to employee attrition within an organization. The insights derived aim to help HR departments develop effective strategies for employee retention, improve workplace satisfaction, and optimize resource allocation.

# Dataset
Dataset Used: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
Source: Kaggle

#  Tools & Technologies Used
Pandas: Data cleaning, manipulation, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) in Python
Excel: Initial data exploration, pivot tables, and visualizations
Power BI: Interactive dashboards, DAX measures, and data storytelling
Tableau	Data visualization and interactive charts
SQL	Querying and filtering data for analysis and reporting

#  Key Analyses Performed
Descriptive Statistics: Summary statistics for numerical and categorical features

Attrition Breakdown: By department, age group, gender, education field, and job role

Correlation Analysis: Found key relationships between features (e.g., job satisfaction vs attrition)

KPI Metrics:

Total Employees

Employees Left

Attrition Rate

Average Age of Employees Who Left

Trend Analysis: Monthly attrition trends using date/time transformations

Key Influencers (Power BI): Identified factors driving attrition using Microsoft's AI-powered visual
